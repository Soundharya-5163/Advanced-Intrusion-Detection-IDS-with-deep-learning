# Advanced-Intrusion-Detection-IDS-with-deep-learning
The project aims to develop an advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that utilizes deep learning techniques to detect and classify sophisticated cyber threats in real-time. The system will analyze network traffic, system logs, and user behavior to identify potential security threats and alert security teams.
